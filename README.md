# Fantasy Football Recommendations

## Objective
Can you predict a championship winning fantasy football team with the right predictive model? 
The purpose of this project is to define whether a predictive model can generate a winning fantasy football roster using existing data from past NFL seasons. 

## Data
The data used was obtained from Kaggle: [NFL Stats 2012-2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/philiphyde1/nfl-stats-1999-2022)

2. Player Metrics
   - Statistical data on player performance, this includes pass yards, rush yards, receiving yards, touchdowns, interceptions, tackles, sacks, etc.. These metrics are broken down by season and game.

3. Fantasy Point
   - Calculated fantasy points for each player based on player performance, following popular fantasy football scoring rules.

4. Team affiliation
